How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can go through lines that are changed and see if there is any mistake introduced by these changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It gives me more freedom to write code and implement new features because I would no longer have to worry about making mistakes as I can always revert back, and I can try out new features without influencing the old, working version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I think mannual commits could be more natural, as I would only make a commit when I want to. In automatic VC like Google docs, it usually commits using a fixed time interval or when the progress is interrupted. These commits are "not natural" as they do not preserve the atomicity of a logical change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    For VCS like Google Docs, each document is usually atomic (self-contained), changes in one file is usually not related to changes in other files. However, VSS like Git are specifically designed for programming projects, where a single logical change requires changes in multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can go into a git repository, and use git log to view the history of commits. Each commit has a unique commit ID, and I can use git diff to compare two commits supplying their commit IDs.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    When I break something, I can always checkout earlier commits to see where bugs are introduced and fix them.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I will use it for all of my future programming and design projects.
