What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    The a .git/ folder is created for storing metadata. I need to do it so that I can start using version control on that repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    The staging area can contains a part to all of the files in the working directory. After a commit, the staging area becomes a part of the repository. It's a temporary folder that gives the user the options to select appropriate group of files in the working directory to commit. After each commit, the staging area is reset, so it also functions as a buffer.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
    I can make sure whatever goes into the staging area before each commit is grouped together logically.
